# Liberate Science API

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/libscie-api.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/libscie-api)

The base API for a p2p scholarly communication infrastructure. More
information on this infrastructure is available in this [conceptual
publication](https://doi.org/10.3390/publications6020021) and this
[technical publication](https://chartgerink.github.io/2018dat-com/)
(note these might have been extended by now).

## Usage

This is an `npm` module that does not export any processes to your
global environment. In other words, it is a module that you can use in
your NodeJS packages, but does not provide any direct functionality
outside of it. If you are looking for a Command Line Interface (CLI),
[we got you covered](https://github.com/libscie/cli).

## Installation

```bash
npm install libscie-api        #if you want to use it in node directly
npm install libscie-api --save #if you want to use it in development of software
```
